# Dungeon Crawler: Name TBD

A turn-based dungeon crawler where **every action burns calories**. Explore deeper floors, fight monsters, solve puzzles, and conserve energy as you descend into the depths.

---

## Game Concept

In this strategy-focused crawler, movement, combat, and abilities consume calories. Players must **manage their health**, scavenge for hidden nutrition bonuses, and make tough calls:
- Fight or sneak?
- Rest or risk a challenge?
- Explore or conserve?

The goal? **Get as deep as possible** before your health runs out â€” then do better next time.

- Randomized events and puzzles
- Global leaderboard: furthest floors reached
- Different strategies for energy management and class playstyles (coming soon)

## Tech Stack

Frontend:
